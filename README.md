# Jude's Python Codes

This repository contains some of the programs I wrote using python programming language.

## Categories

- CLI: Command Line Interface Programs
- GUI: Graphics User Interace Programs

CLI programs use text commands to interact with the program. These kinds of programs are run in the terminal. Output is typically text-based.

GUI programs use visual elements like windows, icons, and menus to interact with the program. Output is graphical and visual.
