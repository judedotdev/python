# Statistics Calculator

This program can calculate:

- Mean of a distribution
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Covariance
- Pearson's correlation coefficient, and
- The determinant of a 2x2 matrix and a 3x3 matrix.

Note: It can calculate this for an infinite number of variables.

## TODO

Upgrade:

It should show workings, the steps it used to arrive at that answer.

First, after the numbers in each row and column has been entered, It should draw the matrix, then proceed to calculate the determinant of a the matrix.
